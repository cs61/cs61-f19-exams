CS 61 Exams Fall 2019
=====================

This repository will hold your answers to exam questions.

Use this GitHub Classroom link to create your personal exam
repository: https://classroom.github.com/a/4A4CIaTv

Then clone your personal exam repository to your laptop.

The day of the exam, **charge your laptop!**

**Immediately before the exam,** go into your laptop’s exam-repository
clone and update your code from the source:

    git pull git://github.com/cs61/cs61-f19-exams.git master

**When you have completed the exam,** commit and push:

    [sign the policy.txt file using your favorite editor]
    git commit -a -m "Done"
    git push
    git status

The `git status` command should say your branch is “up-to-date with
'origin/master'”, and it should not list any “Changes not staged for
commit.”

Good luck!
